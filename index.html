            <p class="secp">Hyper Text Markup Language(HTML):-
                Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is the backbone of any website development process, without which a
                web page does not exist. Hypertext means that text has links, termed hyperlinks, embedded in it. When a
                user clicks on a word or a phrase that has a hyperlink, it will bring another web-page. A markup
                language indicates text can be turned into images, tables, links, and other representations. It is the
                HTML code that provides an overall framework of how the site will look. HTML was developed by Tim
                Berners-Lee. The latest version of HTML is called HTML5 and was published on October 28, 2014 by the W3
                recommendation. This version contains new and efficient ways of handling elements such as video and
                audio files.</p>
            <p class="secp">
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS):-
                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) controls the presentation aspect of the site and allows your site to have
                its own unique look. It does this by maintaining style sheets which sit on top of other style rules and
                are triggered based on other inputs, such as device screen size and resolution.</p>
            <p class="secp">
                JavaScript(Js):-
                JavaScript is an event-based imperative programming language (as opposed to HTML's declarative language
                model) that is used to transform a static HTML page into a dynamic interface. JavaScript code can use
                the Document Object Model (DOM), provided by the HTML standard, to manipulate a web page in response to
                events, like user input.

                Using a technique called AJAX, JavaScript code can also actively retrieve content from the web
                (independent of the original HTML page retrieval), and also react to server-side events as well, adding
                a truly dynamic nature to the web page experience.</p>

            <p class="secp">Android software development is the process by which applications are created for devices
                running the Android operating system. Google states that[3] "Android apps can be written using Kotlin,
                Java, and C++ languages" using the Android software development kit (SDK), while using other languages
                is also possible. All non-JVM languages, such as Go, JavaScript, C, C++ or assembly, need the help of
                JVM language code, that may be supplied by tools, likely with restricted API support. Some programming
                languages and tools allow cross-platform app support (i.e. for both Android and iOS). Third party tools,
                development environments, and language support have also continued to evolve and expand since the
                initial SDK was released in 2008. The official Android app distribution mechanism to end users is Google
                Play; it also allows staged gradual app release, as well as distribution of pre-release app versions to
                testers.</p>
